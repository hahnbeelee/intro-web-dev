# intro-web-dev
Projects from INFO 1300 (Introduction to Web Design &amp; Development) @ Cornell University. 
By taking this course I learned about the conceptual, design, and technical aspects of developing web sites. I also learned basic web technologies such as HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading StyleSheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS).

This course taught me information, visual, and interaction design principles; usability and user testing principles and processes; tools and techniques for working with clients and other users; and a number of other theories and principles that will helped me become a better designer.

## Project Descriptions

### 1 - Personal Website
This project taught me how to use basic HTML and CSS formatting skills and how to make user-centered design decisions.

* Design website for a specific audience's needs.
* Use HTML to structure your content.

### 2 - Redesign the Apple Harvest Festival Website
Project 2 was a chance for me to redesign an existing website, focusing on how the users, uses, and context affect its design. This was done by creating a new site for the [Apple Harvest Festival](https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-harvest-festival/).

- Design a responsive website. One that works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- Learn to evaluate your design through user testing.

### 3 - Form Validation
For Project 3 I added an HTML form to my Project 2 web site. I designed and implemented a form specifically for my original project's target audience. I also validated the form input (client-side only) and included feedback to ensure the user completed the form properly.
#### Skills Gained from this Project

### 4 - Website for Client (Art Commission)
Project 4 was a group project. This project was a chance for me to get some real-world experience in designing and building a website in a team environment. I found my own client and created an innovative, interactive, and interesting website for them. This project provided a chance for me to be creative and use both programming and design to put together a quality web site.
#### Skills Gained from this Project
- Primary Objective: Gain practical "real-world"-like experience (re)designing a web site for an actual client.
- Learn to balance client requirements with good design and meeting the needs of the client's target audience.
- Increase your self assessment skills to evaluate your own work; evaluate your work to determine if you've met client and project requirements.
- Improving your teamwork skills to help you prepare for work outside of school.
