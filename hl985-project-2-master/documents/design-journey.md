# Project 2 - Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.

## Milestone 1

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)
[In this part, write down who your target audience is.]

My target audience is families from out of town who came to Ithaca specifically for Apple Fest. They are not familiar with Ithaca and they want to know what they will get out of their semi-long journey into Ithaca.

### Persona (Milestone 1)
[In this part, create a persona that can represent your target audience, and describe him or her in details below.]

Mary, a 40 year old mom, has 2 kids that are 6 and 4 years old. Her children love food, fairs, live music and events in general. Downtown Ithaca is a 40 minute drive from where she lives.

### Needs (Milestone 1)
[Collect your target audience's needs and wants for the website and list them one by one. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job. See the example design journey for an example of how you might do this.]

Format:
- Need/Want #1
  - **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    - Wants to know if the events will be satisfactory for her kids
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    - have a tab that lists all the stations that will be opened during Apple Festival
  - **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    - Question: Am I allowed to have multiple sections within a page? For example: a section for all the food stations that will be at apple fest and then a separate section for all of the performances within the events page?
- Need/Want #2
  - **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    - Wants to know details about her transportation.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    - Insert a google maps extension onto the site that allows you to put your current location so you will know the best route to get to Apple Festival
    - Below that there will be information about parking
    - Additional information about other forms of transportation will be included to accomadate a larger audience
  - **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    - Question: When we're doing these exercises are we allowed to consider a broad audience yet like I did in the bullet point above?

### Sketches / Screenshots / Storyboards (Milestone 1)
[In this part, include the sketches for each of your pages (both desktop and mobile versions). These sketches **must** be done on paper.]

![](mobile-applefest-sketch.PNG)

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone 1)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2M1 requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in Milestone 1. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey for Milestone 1.]

## Milestone 2

### Task Planning (Milestone 2)
[Plan out your four tasks for Milestone 2 here before doing your user testing]

1. Will the food truck Macarollin be at Apple Fest?

2. What time does Burns and Kristy Band perform?

3. If you are attending Apple Fest do you think it's okay to bring a car as your main form of transportation?

4. You are a middle-aged mom from outside the city of Ithaca. You have 2 young kids that want to go, do you think your kids will have fun if you take them?


### User 1 (Milestone 2)
[In this part, describe your user 1 by answering the questions below.]

1. Who is your user 1, e.g., where user 1 comes from, what is your user 1’s job, characteristics, etc.?
User 1 is a student

2. Does your user 1 belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
No,
[If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?] I catered the tasks so that the user thinks in the mindset of my target audience.


### Tasks for User 1 (Milestone 2)
[Report the results for your user's performance on each of your four tasks. You should **describe the task** you ask the user to complete, explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments in the **memo** field. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.]

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone 2)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the design journey for Milestone 2, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2M2 requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in Milestone 2. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey for Milestone 2.]

## Final Submission

### Task Planning (Final Submission)
[Plan out your four tasks for the Final Submission here before doing your user testing. These should probably be the same as your tasks from Milestone 2, unless you are changing them to address problems with your tasks that you discovered in the first user test.]

1. Based on the information on the site, if you hypothetically had 2 kids (1 6 year old and 1 4 year old) do you think the kids would enjoy apple fest?

2. Based on the information on the site, if you lived 40 minutes away from Downtown Ithaca, do you think it will be worth driving into Ithaca for apple fest?

3. What do you think is the best way to get to Apple Fest?

4. What two streets is Downtown Ithaca located in between?

### User 3 (Final Submission)
[In this part, describe your user 3 by answering the questions below.]

1. Who is your user 3, e.g., where user 3 comes from, what is your user 3’s job, characteristics, etc.?

No
[If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?]
I catered the tasks so that the tester gets into the mindset of an out of town mom.

### Additional Users...
[If you conduct more user tests of your website, copy the sections "User 4" and "Tasks for User 4" to make sections for User 5, User 6, etc. You are not *required* to conduct these additional tests, but you might find them helpful for refining your website.]

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone Final Submission)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2 Final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.]

 -To make my website more responsive I redesigned the home page so that it was not 4 quadrants anymore and rather all the information was in a scroll "column-like" format. Therefore my initial sketch does not 100% replicate my final website. However, I believe that my final website is an improved version of my sketch because of its responsiveness.

 - All broken links were fixed (the problem was that the links all had a semicolon in front of the https:// so I had to remove them all)
