    <h4>Favorite Movie Assignment - 8/27/18</h4>

    	La La Land deeply changed my mindset on sacrifices made to accomplish dreams. La La Land is about two young dreamers, Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), who live in the city of Los Angeles. Mia is an aspiring actress and Sebastian is a lover of jazz who wishes to spread his enthusiasm for jazz to the modern world. At the start of the film, they both face difficulties establishing their dreams; Mia juggles work at a cafe while auditioning for roles and Sebastian is a low-paid pianist at a restaurant. Then, the movie takes a lovely turn when they meet each other, fall in love, and catalyze each other’s dreams. Mia decides to write an one woman play and Sebastian decides to take an offer from his friend Keith (John Legend) to be the pianist for a modern-jazz band. However, Mia believes that Sebastian lost sight of his true dreams because although he is performing in front of large crowds and earning a steady income he isn’t performing classical jazz in front of his personally curated jazz bar. This causes a huge argument between Sebastian and Mia because Sebastian had thought that Mia wanted him to take the modern jazz gig. Directly following the fight Mia performs her one-woman show and Sebastian does not show up due his job scheduling conflicts which causes Mia to drive back to her hometown and recover her roots.

    	After doing so Mia gets casted for a role as the main character for a huge movie to be filmed in Paris. Mia and Sebastian break up because she has to film in Paris for a year and the movie picks up a few years later where Mia has accomplished her dreams and is a blockbuster movie star and Sebastian is an owner of his very own jazz bar called “Seb’s.” Mia has moved on from Sebastian and is now married and has a kid. The movie ends when she and her husband decide to nonchalantly walk into a bar and it just so happens to be “Seb’s”. Sebastian is hosting and plays the classical recurring melody “City of Stars” and the music takes them on a journey of what could have happened if they decided to stay together. It is an ending that we all wish were true, but it is not reality. The cold brutal truth is that in order for them to truly follow their dreams their relationship would never have worked out.

    	La La Land holds a special place for me because I fell in love with all of the dynamics of the movie: the cinematography, music, choreography, actors, and plot. The way the movie is advertised makes you believe that it will be a simple love story musical where they both end up together and successfully follow their dreams as a duo; but, La La Land is far from that. I highly appreciate how thoroughly every scene, script, and note was meticulously placed all throughout the film. As a person who adores art and music and has considered pursuing it as a career path I understand how difficult it must be to follow an artistic dream. The sacrifices and hardships they faced in order to achieve those dreams are so realistic and dedicated. It was such a brutal wake up call when they did not end up together, and although nobody wants to admit it events and sacrifices like that happen in our lives all the time. La La Land is my favorite movie of all time because it’s beautifully made and simultaneously realistic.

    	Director Jean-Luc Goddard said “Film is truth 24 times a second, and every cut is a lie;” this quote applies to La La Land because every scene is filmed in a very lovely fashion where every cut is beautiful and the color schemes and lighting are all conscientiously placed, but the ending is brutally realistic and the plot is not restricted to the aesthetics of the cuts. Contrastingly, La La Land can also be applied to Michael Haneke’s take on the same quote “Film is 24 lies per second at the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth,” because the beauty of the cinematography initially distracts the viewer from realizing the true theme of La La Land which is that life is not always romanticized and temporary happiness must be sacrificed to achieve your ultimate dreams. Both quotes can be applied to La La Land fittingly; the colorful lights and outfits are deceiving of the deglamorized nature of the plot.

    	La La Land is a surprising film that exhibits itself like a light hearted musical, but is a crushingly real and simultaneously memorizing anecdote that can be applied to many different personalities and lives. It’s a piece of art that speaks to anyone who has had dilemmas in either their love life or career. La La Land has given me a new appreciation for the depth of musicals and films in general and has powerfully impacted my view on life.
